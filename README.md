# Wait4IT
Are you tired of waiting on IT well wait no more it slices, it dices, it does it all.
Hello there and welcome to Wait4IT
My name is Jon Klepinger and I am a Telecommunication's voice and data networking mortal.
I've had a GitHub login for many years but unfortunately have not used it much(really not at all, if we are being honest).
My OS interest's lie in Linux & FreeBSD. I've dabled in both PERL and Python mostly for scrubbing Excel and Word documents in order to build voice switch scripts(automate) those boring, mindless repetitive tasks.
I thought Wait4IT was a catchy name for a repo. I did'nt feel like using the defacto Hello-World.
Wishing you all the best and blessings(in whatever Religion, higher power, Being, Force) you believe in or follow.
